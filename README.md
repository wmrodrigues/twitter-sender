# twitter-sender
Simple process to send twit messages to profiles of a list from a csv file

The motivation to build this small and simple project was based on appeal made by congressman [Kim Kataguiri](https://www.instagram.com/kimkataguiri), saying that we should ask to our fellow deputies congressmen for support to approve his anti privileges constitutional amendment. Well, this project served to its purposes but I think it can be used by anyone else that wants to help.  

### Requirements:
* [Go lang 1.13](https://golang.org/doc/go1.13)
